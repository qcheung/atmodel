# The 1st 4 functions defined calculate BLING(squared) for the backgrounds
# The 3 functions after calculate antenna temperature for the backgrounds(a preliminary step for the BLING functions)
    # There is no temperature function for "bling_sub" since those backgrounds have given temperatures in data files
# The functions after that calculate: limiting flux, integration time, and total signal
